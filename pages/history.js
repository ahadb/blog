        <p>Thanks for taking the time to stop by, my name is Ahad. I'm with my incredible journey on the web since i built my first table based web page in 1999.
         It's been near 20 years since then and things have changed exponentially in the world of the web. At my day job I'm a Senior UI/JavaScript Software Engineer and
          spend time working with mainly React, Redux and Node building single page applications - I'm grateful to everyone who have made it possible for developers like
          myself to forge respectable careers out of writing software for the web. It's been changes to web technologies like JavaScript from the community that have helped
          us grow both in our careers and skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time has led me to believe and appreciate the fact that limitations are products of our imaginations and thinking, this forms my strong belief that anything is possible. I
          think we all have stories to tell about how we learned to program and how we failed only to be self inspired to try again and again. For me that self-inspiration has been the key
          to longevity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like to build things, write software and have been blogging intermittently since around 2005. I'm a staunch advocate of open source and try to contribute to the
          community as much as time permits. After working for many years I've had an epiphany, if you're going to make a career coding for the man then you might as well
          take some time to code for yourself - most will say its no fun coding for someone else, therein i have really no opinion, however I will opine that developers need their own stuff
          to build and nurture. We mostly do that out of office, unless of course you happen to be one of the lucky ones! Some create that luck ....
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been writing software for the enterprise for some time now and I feel it needs alot of improvement, especially in the open source world and also directly within the enterprise;
          I won't get into the why's and what's at this point but my aim is to contribute to this niche. Apart from just blogging, I built Ahadb.org to explore more about JavaScript architecture,
          it's future, and how we can improve our use of it within the enterprise.

        </p>

        <p>At times I also curate content from the best niche authors on the web (a habit I picked up years ago) and I hope you enjoy them and continue to journey with me as I explore 2018 and beyond
          - I guarantee you the next 5 will be, just as, if not more important than the previous in terms of web innovation, tooling and client side technology.</p>
