        <p>Thanks for taking the time to stop by. My name's Ahad and I'm still traveling on this incredible journey on the web since i built my first table based web page in 1999.
         It's been near 20 years since then and I'm still developing using modern tools and languages, aka of course JavaScript. At my day job I'm a Senior UI/JavaScript Software Engineer and
          spend time working with mainly React, Redux and Node (I've worked with all the popular FE stacks, Angular xx, Vue, Polymer, Backbone, jQuery) - I'm grateful to everyone who have made
          it possible for developers like myself to forge pretty decent careers out of writing software for the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time has led me to believe and appreciate the fact that limitations are products of our imaginations and thinking, this forms my strong belief that anything is possible. I
          think we all have stories to tell about how we learned to program and how we failed only to be self inspired to try again and again. For me that self-inspiration has been the key
          to longevity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like to build things, write software and have been blogging intermittently since around 2005. I'm a staunch advocate of open source and try to contribute to the
          community as much as time permits. After working for many years I've had an epiphany, if you're going to have a career coding for the man then you might as well
          take some time to code for yourself - most people will say its no fun coding for someone else, I have no solid opinions on that but I will opine that nerds need their own stuff
          to build and nurture. We mostly do that out of office, unless of course you happen to be one of the lucky ones! Some create that luck ....
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been writing software in the financial sector for some time now and I feel it needs alot of improvement, especially in the open source world and also directly within the enterprise;
          I won't get into the why's and what's at this point but my aim is to contribute to this niche. I built Ahadb.org to explore more about JavaScript architecture, future, code and JavaScript
          in the modern finance world. This is the place i'll be sharing my thoughts as well as open source projects with the world within the finance niche ranging from topics about architecture,
          modern front end tech, future, implementation, management, business and more.
        </p>

        <p>At times I also curate content from the best niche authors on the web (a habit I picked up years ago) and I hope you enjoy them and continue to journey with me as I explore 2018 and beyond
          - I guarantee you the next 5 will be, just as, if not more important than the previous in terms of web innovation, tooling and client side technology.</p>
